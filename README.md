# Hangman

Simple Hangman Game, Currently a WIP.

Hangman is a game where the user attempts to guess a word by guessing letters they think are in the word. 
Everytime the guess a letter incorrectly, a they get one step closer to hanging a stick man. 
If the stickman is hung, the user looses the game.
